# Automating Incident Classification Using Sentiment Analysis and Logistic Regression

There are two different logistic regression machine learning models in this repository, which differ in the number of features.
The first machine learning model (old_model.py) utilizes the overall sentiment score of a text
whereas the second one (new_model.py) also takes into account the individual sentiment score of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 
The second machine learning model is essentially identical to the first except for 3 additional features.
A more rigorous comparison between the two models will be published in an upcoming journal paper.*

old_model.py is the companion code to this paper: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03712-3_5
